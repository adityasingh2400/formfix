# Product Flow & UX

## Capture & upload
- User guidance: side/front angle suggestions; ensure feet-to-head framing; 3–6s clip, 720p.
- Camera-smart checks: reject low-visibility; prompt to recapture.

## Processing pipeline
- Pose → smoothing → phase segmentation → rule/ML inference → assemble feedback.
- Mode selection: quick check (fast rules) vs deep check (3D + sequence model).

## Output artifacts
- Annotated video/GIF; key-frame screenshots.
- Angle charts vs pro bands; sequencing/rhythm score; top 3 issues with severity/confidence.
- Drill prescriptions linked to detected issues.

## User progression
- Session history with variance/consistency tracking.
- Archetype assignment (later) with suggested progression steps.
