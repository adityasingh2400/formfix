# Basketball Form AI – Feature Ideas

## Near-term (pairs with MVP)
- Pro/peer comparisons: side-by-side synced playback, overlaid angles, timing deltas; “match me to this pro” mode.
- Rhythm/sequence grade: phase timeline (load → set → rise → release → follow-through), DTW-style alignment score, early/late flags.
- Release optimizer: release angle/height/speed vs distance, highlight under/over-arc; small joint delta targets.
- Off-hand hygiene: detect push/torque, lateral force risk, off-hand distance/contact duration visuals.
- Balance/base score: COM over base at set/release/landing; foot alignment; sway score; landing symmetry.
- Consistency tracker: variance of angles/timings across sessions; streaks; tightness badge.
- Drill prescriptions: map issues to specific drills with short demos; adaptive playlists as issues resolve.
- Camera-smart capture: framing guidance and auto-discard low-confidence clips.
- Latency modes: “quick check” (2D + rules) vs “deep check” (3D + sequence model).
- Visual debugger: overlays, angles, issue markers per frame; phase timeline; confidence/visibility warnings.

## Mid-term (after stable 3D + sequence model)
- Archetype finder: cluster pros into style archetypes; show nearest archetype for user and 1–2 alternative archetypes with pros/examples.
- Sequencing templates: archetype-specific timing templates; graded rhythm score with recommended timing deltas.
- Outcome-aware hints: if make/miss/EV available, surface which angles/timings correlate with improved % for the user’s archetype.
- Multi-distance profiles: separate baselines for FT, mid, corner 3, above-the-break 3, off-dribble; show where mechanics leak.
- Social challenges: form challenges (e.g., “clean release” week), leaderboards by rhythm or consistency.
- Team/coach workspace: compare players, tag clips, assign drills, monitor adherence and improvement over time.
- Injury-preventative cues: flag trunk lean, knee valgus, wrist overuse patterns; volume-aware reminders.

## Later/experimental
- AR overlay (mobile): live skeleton, target bands, and timing buzz alerts during practice.
- Hardware tie-ins: optional IMUs for velocity/accel sanity when video is occluded; fuse with vision.
- Progression advisor: “next 5% change” suggestions to move toward a target archetype without wholesale form swaps.
